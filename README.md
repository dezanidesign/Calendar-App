# Calendar-App
A calendar App that that allows the user to store reminders on a 9 - 5 timescale that stores the data locally. Using moment js and jQuery the timeblocks from the past will be displayed differently from current.

Fun project, initially had some difficulty with storing data and retrieing but eventually got it working. A lot is using Javasccript instead of JQuery as my understanding is better but will soon convert to Jquery.
